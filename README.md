# Gold-Forecasting-with-Linear-Regression-ARIMA
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting gold prices based on various economic indicators, such as crude oil prices, interest rates, USD/INR exchange rates, Sensex, CPI, and the USD Index. The analysis is performed using both regression modeling and time series forecasting techniques to understand and predict the trends in gold prices.

Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A thorough analysis of historical gold prices is conducted, including visualizations to identify trends and patterns. The relationships between gold prices and other economic indicators are explored using correlation analysis.

Linear Regression Modeling: A linear regression model is developed to assess the impact of economic factors on gold prices. The model helps to quantify how changes in crude oil, interest rates, exchange rates, and other variables influence the price of gold.

Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA): To predict future gold prices, an ARIMA model is employed. This model captures the temporal patterns in gold price data and provides short-term forecasts based on historical trends.

Model Evaluation: Both the linear regression and ARIMA models are evaluated using accuracy metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE. These metrics assess the reliability and performance of the models in predicting gold prices.

Visualization: The project includes various visual representations, such as line plots of gold prices over time, correlation matrices, and actual vs. predicted gold prices, helping to convey the insights derived from the data.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of gold prices, combining statistical modeling and forecasting techniques to deliver actionable insights. It highlights the influence of key economic indicators on gold prices and offers predictions for future trends.
